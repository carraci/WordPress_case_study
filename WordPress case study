WordPress is a popular **open-source content management system (CMS)** that allows users to create and manage websites. Let’s explore the developmental models, licensing, modes of funding, and commercial and non-commercial use of WordPress.

**Developmental Models**: WordPress follows an open-source development model similar to Android. It is maintained and developed by a community of contributors who work together to improve the platform. The WordPress community includes developers, designers, translators, and other contributors who collaborate on the core software and create themes, plugins, and other extensions¹.

**Licensing**: WordPress is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later¹. This license grants users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute WordPress without any restrictions. It ensures that any modifications made to the original source code are shared with the community.

**Modes of Funding**: WordPress is primarily funded through a combination of community contributions, corporate sponsorships, and revenue from related products and services. The WordPress Foundation, a non-profit organization, oversees the project’s finances and supports its continued development¹.

**Commercial and Non-Commercial Use**: WordPress can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes. Many businesses and organizations use WordPress to create websites for their products, services, or online presence. Additionally, individuals can use WordPress for personal blogs or non-profit initiatives without any licensing fees or restrictions¹.
